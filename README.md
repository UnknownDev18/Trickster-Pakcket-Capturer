It is packet capturer for Trickster Online. It captures from the its latest client(korean version).

## How to use
1) Install 'SharpPCap' and 'D2Coding' font.
2) Check the file 'dictionary.key', 'settings.cfg' is in same folder with executable binary(Trickster_PacketCapture_GUI.exe).
3) Modify the IP address in 'settings.cfg'. <br>
But be careful, it only captures in TCP mode, so loopback packets would be ignored.
4) Run main binary and enjoy!
